Hi 
This is TIK being made by the Students of MIT, Manipal as a study kernel
Initially started with Tutorial from http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html which was changed and improved
TIK is avaliable under GPL v2 ( see GPL.txt file for info )
To contribute contact any of the Project Owners

You will require nasm and gcc
to complie just use make like this:

make clean
make


you can use makeiso.sh to make an iso for the kernel source which can be booted with any Virtual Machine like Qemu
like this
./makeiso.sh
this will make a file TIK.iso
use this iso in any Virtual Machine or burn on a CD and boot from it


you can also directly boot from TIK with grub (http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)
like this:

root (YOUR ROOT DEVICE)
kernel (YOUR PATH)/kernel
boot

For e.g 

root (hd0,0)
kernel /home/xyz/tik/kernel
